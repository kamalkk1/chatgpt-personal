Chat application where users could interact with an AI Assistant that answers financial questions professionally and in detail. Leveraging my skills in React and Vite, I successfully developed the web app, incorporating both client and server code. To enhance the functionality, I integrated ChatEngine and ChatGPT from OpenAI, and hosted the application on Vercel.

Development Process
I began by setting up the project using React with Vite, which provided a fast and efficient development environment. The core functionality revolved around creating a seamless chat experience, so I integrated ChatEngine to handle the chat interface and communication. For the AI Assistant, I utilized ChatGPT from OpenAI, which required careful configuration to ensure the assistant responded accurately and professionally to financial queries.

Key Features Implemented
Assistant Instructions: I defined specific instructions to shape the AI Assistant's personality, style of writing, and formatting, ensuring consistent and professional responses.
Data Interaction: Users could ask questions about their data, utilizing file search and function calling to provide the assistant with necessary information for context-aware responses.
Conversation Threads: For returning users, I implemented the Assistant APIâ€™s threading capability to retain up to 25 previous messages, creating a continuous and coherent chat experience.
Dynamic Response Streaming: To enhance user engagement, I enabled streaming of the assistant's responses, allowing users to see the AI dynamically type out answers in real-time.
Deployment and Documentation
After thoroughly testing the application, I deployed it on Vercel, ensuring it was accessible and performant. Additionally, I created a basic documentation file detailing the technical aspects of the app, including setup instructions, key components, and API integrations.

This project not only reinforced my expertise in React and modern web development tools but also provided valuable experience in integrating advanced AI capabilities. I am proud of the final product and the positive feedback it received for its usability and functionality. This experience has further motivated me to explore new technologies and innovative solutions in my future projects.
